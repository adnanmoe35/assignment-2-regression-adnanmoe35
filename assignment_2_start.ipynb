        "### Predict the TOTAL COMPENSATION for this year.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data file provided is a salary survey for tech workers in Europe. We want to predict the total amount of compensation they bring in each year, based off of the details of their work.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some notes that will be important:\n",
        "<ul>\n",
        "    <li>The total compensation will need to be constructed, there is a column for salary, \"Yearly brutto salary (without bonus and stocks) in EUR\", as well as a column for bonus compensation, \"Yearly bonus + stocks in EUR\".\n",
        "    <li>Some categorical variables will need some work, and there isn't generally an exact answer. The main concern is things with categories that have a bunch of values with a very small count. For example, if there is only 1 person in City X, then that value likely needs to be addressed. We don't want it encoded into a new column of one 1 and thousands of 0s.\n",
        "    <li>There is an article exploring some of the data here: https://www.asdcode.de/2021/01/it-salary-survey-december-2020.html\n",
        "    <li>Imputation and a bit of data manipulation will be required.\n",
        "    <li>Use any regression method you'd like. Some ones are closely related to what we've done, you may want to look at them, e.g. ExtraTreesRegressor.\n",
        "    <li>Initial accurracy, and potentially final accuracy, may not be great. When I made a plain model will little optimization the errors were large and the R2 was low. There is lots of room for optimization.\n",
        "    <li>Research challenge - try some work on the target, look into TransformedTargetRegressor and see if that helps. Recall in stats when we had skewed distributions... Maybe it helps, maybe it doesn't.\n",
        "    <li>EDA and data prep are up to you - you'll probably need to do a little exploring to figure out what cleanup is needed. When I did it, I did things kind of iteratively when I did it. For example, look at the value counts, figure out how to treat the different categories, clean something up, look at the results, potentially repeat if needed. After you figure out what needs to be done, you may be able to take some of those steps and incorporate them into a pipeline to be cleaner....\n",
        "    <li><b>CRITICAL - Please make sure your code runs with RUN ALL. It should load the data that you're given, do all the processing, and spit out results. Comment out or remove anything that you've cleaned up and don't need - e.g. if you scaled a value manually, then moved that into a pipeline, don't leave the original scaling code active when the file is run.</b>\n",

        "        <li> Hyperparameter Changes / Grid Search Improvements. What did you try, and why. Similar explaination to above, short.\n",
        "        <li> Overall this section should be roughly as long as this intro block - just outline what the results were, what you did to improve, and the results after.\n",
        "        <li> If you could use titles/bullet points I'd really appreciate it.\n",

        "        <li> Accuracy: 20% As compared to everyone else. This will be generously graded, I won't be surprised if overall accuracy is low for most people.\n",

        "The baseline Ridge regression model achieved a training R² of 0.55 and a test R² of 0.14. The training RMSE was approximately €28,134, and the test RMSE was approximately €40,962. The drop from training to test indicates some overfitting, but the model still captures meaningful patterns related to experience, role, and technology.\n",
        "\n",
        "After feature selection and hyperparameter tuning, performance was compared to the baseline to evaluate improvements in generalization.\n",
        "### Feature Selection Activities\n",
        "Removed all salary, bonus, and compensation-related columns from the predictors to prevent data leakage.\n",
        "\n",
        "Grouped rare categorical values (e.g., City and technology columns with fewer than 10 observations) into “Other” to reduce sparse one-hot encoding and improve stability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dropped the high-cardinality column “Other technologies/programming languages you use often” and compared performance to assess its impact.\n",
        "### Hyperparameter Changes\n",
        "Used GridSearchCV to tune the Ridge regression regularization parameter (alpha) over values [0.1, 1, 10, 100] using 5-fold cross-validation. The best alpha was selected based on cross-validation R², and the tuned model was evaluated on the test set to compare performance against the baseline."
